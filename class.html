	<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
	<p>To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:
<br>
Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
<br>
Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format
<br>
Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
<br>
HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.</p>
